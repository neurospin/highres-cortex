/** Compute the distance along the gradient of a scalar field.
 *
 * In the object defined by \p domain_label, the distance \f$d\f$ to \p
 * origin_label is computed along the field lines of the gradient of \p
 * upwind_field (\f$T\f$). This is done by integrating the following equation
 * in a single sweep through the domain, using an upwinding condition on
 * \f$T\f$:
 *
 * \f[
 * \nabla d \cdot \frac{\nabla T}{\|\nabla T\|} = 1
 * \f]
 *
 * The \p domain image will be modified in-place for keeping track of the front
 * (\p front_label) and visited voxels (\p done_label).
 *
 * Preconditions:
 *  \arg \p upwind_field must have at least a 1-voxel border, which must be
 *    filled with \e NaN
 *  \arg \p domain must have at least a 1-voxel border, which will must not
 *    contain \p domain_label
 *  \arg \p domain_label, \p origin_label, \p done_label, and \p front_label
 *    must all have different values (except \p origin_label and \p done_label
 *    can be equal)
