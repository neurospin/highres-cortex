      Compute the filtered sum of principal curvatures of isophote surfaces

      This is equivalent to computing the divergence of the normalized gradient
      of the input scalar field.

      .. note::

         A Gaussian smoothing of width sigma is first applied to the input
         image, in order to limit the appearance of local high curvature values
         (e.g. due to the discontinuity of second-order derivative at the
         borders of the cortex).
