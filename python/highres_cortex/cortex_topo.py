def fix_cortex_topology(input_classif, filling_size=2., fclosing=10.):
    """Fix the topology of a cortical segmentation.

    The topology of a hollow sphere is imposed onto a voxelwise segmentation of
    the cortex, which consists of the following labels:

    Label 0 (`CSF_LABEL`)
        Outside of the cortex, corresponding to the cerebrospinal fluid,
        defined in 26-connectivity.

    Label 100 (`CORTEX_LABEL`)
        The cortex itself, defined using 6-connectivity.

    Label 200 (`WHITE_LABEL`)
        Inside of the cortex, corresponds to the white matter,
        defined in 26-connectivity.


    Parameters
    ----------

    classif: aims.Volume
        The input voxelwise classification.

    filling_size: float
        The size, in millimetres, of the largest holes in either cortical
        boundary that will be filled. This must be kept smaller than the
        smallest cortical thickness in the image (see `Method` below for a more
        precise description of this parameter). The default value is 2 mm,
        which is appropriate for a human brain.

    fclosing: float
        The radius, in millimetres, of the morphological closing which is used
        by VipHomotopic in Cortical surface mode to retrieve the brain's outer
        envelope. The default value, 10 mm, is appropriate for a human brain.

    Returns
    -------

    The topology-corrected voxelwise classification is returned in an
    `aims.Volume_S16`.

    Raises
    ------

    OSError
        This function throws ``OSError`` if ``VipHomotopic`` cannot be found
        or executed.

    subprocess.CalledProcessError
        This exception can occur if ``VipHomotopic``, which is in charge of the
        homotopic morphological operations, terminates with an error.


    Environment
    -----------

    This function needs the ``VipHomotopic`` command from the Morphologist
    image segmentation pipeline to reside in the ``PATH``. Note that the
    original ``VipHomotopic`` has hard-coded limits on the number of iterations
    for morphological operations, which may be exceeded when working on
    high-resolution (sub-millimetre) images.

    Input/output
    ------------

    The command ``VipHomotopic``, which is used to perform the homotopic
    morphological operations, reports progress on stdout/stderr.

    Images are passed to ``VipHomotopic`` using files under a temporary
    directory allocated with `tempfile.mkdtemp`.

    Method
    ------

    The topology correction is done in two main steps:

    1. A topologically spherical bounding box of the brain is computed and
    dilated towards the inside until it reaches the white matter. This
    retrieves a topologically correct object which fits the grey--white
    boundary.

    2. The previous object is eroded from the inside in the region where it
    overlaps with the cortex. This retrieves a topologically correct pial
    boundary.

    Each of these main steps is performed in two sub-steps: first the homotopic
    morpholological operation is performed until a boundary which is dilated by
    `filling_size`, then to the original boundary. This guides the front
    propagation, in order to prevent the formation of spurious strands.

    This method will change voxels from the cortex class to either the white
    matter or the CSF class, as needed to ensure the topology.

    Note that the output is not a deterministic function of the input, because
    the homotopic operations use a pseudo-random order for the front
    propagation.
