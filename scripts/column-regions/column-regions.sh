# Why is the previous step necessary?
#
# The obvious alternative is to do exactly as described in the OHBM paper: do
# the projections on the original labels of each voxel.
#
# The previous case aggregates the adjacent voxels of one interface that point
# towards the same voxel on the other interface. This reduces
# over-segmentation.
#
# Another way of reducing over-segmentation would be to aggregate together
# voxels that have one projection in common, instead of both (see conjunction
# step later on). But this introduces the problem of transitivity. This was
# investigated previously on the ferret data (under the name Billiard), but was
# considered a dead-end and the above solution seems to solve this problem most
# efficiently.


# There is a problem with the propagation of labels: the step size is fixed,
# which means that sometimes the point can skip the corner of a voxel, and thus
# go directly from a bulk voxel to an outside voxel. In this case it is
# recorded as a "dead-end" advection path, no resulting label is recorded and
# it appears as zero in the result.
#
# This problem also appears in the previous "exchange" step, but is mitigated
# by the subsequent connex component detection (each failed propagation is
# assigned a different label).
#
# Quick fix: fix the conjunction step to not aggregate zeros.
#
# TODO: the proper way to fix this would be to force the advection path to
# respect the boundaries of voxels, so that the corner of voxels cannot be
# skipped over. This would also prevent the advection path from crossing the
# thin CSF surface within the sulcus (comes from skeleton).

# I could take into account the fake cortex–CSF interface that exists at the
# cut plane, by assigning it a special label (e.g. 500000000) in the
# exchanged_propvol label. It would then need to be treated specially: any
# voxel that projects onto this label would be excluded from the region list,
# and thus would not take part in the merging step. This would prevent the
# creation of regions that connect to this spurious surface, but this would not
# prevent the nearby regions from being deformed by the perturbation of the
# field. It would thus probably be overkill to implement this special case.
# Care is needed when dealing with regions close to the cut plane anyway.
